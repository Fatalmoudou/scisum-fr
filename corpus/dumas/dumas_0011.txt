This document summarizes a 6 months internship that took place within the Human Factor department of the Airbus Company in Toulouse, France. This internship was centred on a virtual agent research thematic. Our initial hypothesis was that a system of automatic intent categorization could benefit from using synthetic “natural-like” data. In order to validate or invalidate this hypothesis we decided, first, to create a methodology that would help us collect natural questions from end-users. Then we used the “natural” data we previously collected along with a synthetic question generator we designed in order to output synthetic questions that feels “natural-like” if compared to the input ones. Lastly, we experimented on the synthetic datasets using various tools in order to put to the test our initial hypothesis. The results we obtained from these tests allowed us to open new perspectives on the natural language understanding part of the virtual agent system.
